## Contributions

We accept contributions from anyone and are grateful even for the smallest fixes.

If you want to help Proof, please fork and setup the development environment of the appropriate repository. In the case you want to submit substantial changes, please get in touch with our development team on our slack channel \(slack.proofsuite.com\) to verify those modifications are in line with the general goal of the project and receive early feedback. Otherwise you are welcome to fix, commit and send a pull request for the maintainers to review and merge into the main code base.

Please make sure your contributions adhere to our coding guidelines:

* Code must adhere as much as possible to standard conventions \(DRY - Separation of concerns - Modular\)
* Pull requests need to be based and opened against the master branch
* Commit messages should properly describe the code modified
* Ensure all tests are passing before submitting a pull request
